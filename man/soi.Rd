\title{Self-Organised Instability Model Community Simulation}
\usage{
soi(
  N,
  I,
  A,
  migr_rates = runif(N, min = 0.1, max = 0.8),
  death_rates = runif(N, min = 0.01, max = 0.08),
  com = NULL,
  tend,
  k = 5,
  norm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{number of species}

\item{I}{community size, number of available sites (individuals)}

\item{A}{interaction matrix of dimension NxN}

\item{migr_rates}{species-specific immigration probabilities (also determine initial abundances)}

\item{death_rates}{species-specific extinction probabilities}

\item{com}{Initial community abundances vector. If NULL (default), based on migration rates.}

\item{tend}{number of timepoints to be returned in the time series (nr of generations)}

\item{k}{the number of transition events that are allowed to take place during one leap.
By default set to 5. Higher values reduce runtime, but also accuracy of the simulation.}

\item{norm}{logical to indicate whether the time series should be returned
with the abundances as proportions (norm = TRUE) or the raw counts (norm = FALSE, default)}
}
\value{
matrix with species abundances as rows and time points as columns
}
\description{
Generate time-series with the self-organised instability (SOI) model.
Implements a K-leap method for accelerating stochastic simulation.
}
\examples{
soi(N = 10, I = 1000, A = powerlawA(n = 10, alpha = 1.2), tend = 150, norm = TRUE)
