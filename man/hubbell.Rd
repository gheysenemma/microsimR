\title{Hubbell community simulation}
\usage{
hubbell(
  N,
  M,
  I,
  d,
  m,
  pbirth = runif(N, min = 0, max = 1),
  pmigr = runif(M, min = 0, max = 1),
  tskip = 0,
  tend,
  norm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Amount of different species initially in the local community}

\item{M}{Amount of different species in the metacommunity, including those of the local community}

\item{I}{Fixed amount of individuals in the local community}

\item{d}{Fixed amount of deaths of local community individuals in each generation}

\item{m}{Immigration rate: the probability that a death in the local community is
replaced by a migrant of the metacommunity rather than by the birth of a local community member}

\item{pbirth}{probabilities of birth to construct the initial abundances,
will be updated in all next generations with previous abundances}

\item{pmigr}{probabilities of migration}

\item{tskip}{Nr of generations that should not be included in the outputted species
abundance matrix.}

\item{tend}{Nr of simulations to be simulated.}

\item{norm}{logical to indicate whether the time series should be returned
with the abundances as proportions (norm = TRUE) or the raw counts
(norm = FALSE, default)}
}
\value{
matrix with species abundances as rows and time points as columns
}
\description{
Neutral species abundances simulation according to the Hubbell model.
