\title{Interaction matrix with Power-Law network adjacency matrix}
\usage{
powerlawA(n, alpha, stdev = 1, s = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of species}

\item{alpha}{the power-law distribution parameter. Should be > 1.
Larger values will give lower interaction strength heterogeneity,
whereas values closer to 1 give strong heterogeneity in interaction strengths between the species.
In other words, values of alpha close to 1 will give Strongly Interacting Species (SIS).}

\item{stdev}{the standard deviation parameter of the normal distribution with mean 0 from which
the elements of the nominal interspecific interaction matrix N are drawn}

\item{s}{scaling parameter with which the final global interaction matrix A is multiplied}
}
\value{
The global interaction matrix A with n rows and n columns.
}
\description{
Generate an interaction matrix A that can be decomposed as NH.Gs .
Where N is the Normal Interspecific Interaction matrix, H the interaction strength heterogeneity
drawn from a power-law distribution with given parameter alpha, and G the adjacency matrix of
power-law out-degree digraph ecological network, and s a scaling factor. Diagonal elements of A are subsequently set to -1.
}
\examples{
# Low interaction heterogeneity
A_low <- powerlawA(n = 10, alpha = 3)
# Strong interaction heterogeneity
A_strong <- powerlawA(n = 10, alpha = 1.01)
